# Prisoner's Dilemma

Rust implementation of the Prisoner's Dilemma.
Inspired by [Veritasium's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM).
  
Disclaimer: project mainly used to learning Rust language and play around this beautiful problem. Library not mature for production use (yet?).

## TODO

- [ ] StrategyGradual (fix)
- [ ] Add every known strategies, along with their tests.
- [ ] Make sure the lib actually has library structure/release.
- [ ] Make a GUI/Cli. Something to allow to play with it.

## Experiments

- [ ] Constant data. Pure constant data. Even if that implies lifetime annotations. Walk that mille.


## Pending Strategies

- 12.pdf -> probabilistic strategies
- https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/blob/dev/axelrod/strategies/_strategies.py
- **mem2**: Complex strategy shifting between all_d, tit_for_tat, and tf2t based on recent outcomes and pays attention to memory, adjusting strategy accordingly.
- Probability p Cooperator - Unlikely: Not directly represented
- Suspicious Tit for Tat (STFT)
- Imperfect TFT (ImpTFT)
- Omega Tit for Tat (Î©TFT)
- Discriminating Altruist (DA)
- n-Pavlov
- Adaptive Pavlov (APavlov)
- Reactive (R(y,p,q))
- Memory-one (S(p,q,r,s))
- Zero Determinant (ZD)
- Equalizer (SET-n)
- Extortionary (Extort-n)
- Generous (Gen-n)
- Good (GOOD)
